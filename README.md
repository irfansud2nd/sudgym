# Sud Gym - Exercise Information Website

## Introduction
Sud Gym is a website that provides information about exercise routines, sourced from the [exerciseDB API](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb). I developed this application following the tutorial by [JavaScript Mastery](https://youtu.be/KBpoBc98BwM), but with a slightly different tech stack. I utilized TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, whereas JavaScript Mastery used regular JavaScript and Material UI.
